## ETL And Data Cleaning
Data claning and ETL is the process of obtaining the data using a data connector, transforming the data into useful format using power query editor and loading it into report view for visualization and analysis. 
The folowing steps where taken to clean this dataset:

1)Excel data connector was used to fetch the data from my local storage

2) Load the data into powerquery editor for cleaning

3)Convert ID and sku-code into strings to make data type to be uniform

4)Remove the last row on the poduct table because the row was filled with  null  values

5)Replace blank cells and null values on the kpi_level column with 'NO', this is because null and emptiness signify negative or No.

6)Replace null with zeros on numeric columns
